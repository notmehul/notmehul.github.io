## Hello World

This is me, Mehul, welcome to my corner of the web, I plan to make this into a rolling blog site which I can fill with the random ideas and theories which pop in my head. This page is like my intro about what I do, my interests and stuff, I'll try keeping it fun to read, promise ðŸ¤ž

Ex Product team @ *[Slick App](https://slickapp.co)* where we scaled from zero to 2 Million users in a span of 10 months. Launched cool new features for the GenZ college audience of India and created close knit communities. It's always a wonderful feeling when you meet a couple at a bar and they credit your app to be the reason they are together.

I'm guessing you have heard about **AI taking over jobs?** Well, I had a team of 5 interns who I got annoyed with and automated their work over a weekend hack. In my defense, they were also not liking the work as it was repetitive. Smart kids should have smart things to work on.

For my undergrad, I studied CS at *Manipal University Jaipur*. Where I found my love of AI and making things to improve people's lives. While my time in uni, I started India's first Student Research Society called Phi Phenomenon which started a culture of research in our college which never existed before. Literal freshman used to come upto me and ask for research project advices. This might be a common thing for western people but trust me, no one in india gives a fuck about scientific research and the fact that I was able to make it a better experience for everyone interested was awesomesauce.

I like doing that, **creating things at places which lack them.** 

I started a few startup projects of mine during the time which didnt see the light of day mostly due lack of investor interest. I still stand by my ideas and will continue to love them till death. RIP Circles.

Okay, enough background

## Tech

Currently: MacOS with Yabai and Skhd

![Rice](/rice.png)

Love learning and building things. Converted Arch Linux user of 5 years.

JavaScript and Microsoft hate
GoLang and Python love

My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/notmehul/) would be a more accurate representation of this section ig

## âœ¨ Personality âœ¨

Apart from work, you can find me either reading Philosophy (currently Machiavelli ðŸš©) or watching cool Art stuf (prolly Basquiat) with music in the background (most definitely Radiohead)

I listen to mostly everything non mainstream, the range goes from Shoegaze to Folk acoustic. I have quite a god complex about my music taste which led me to making this playlist, feel free to use it ðŸ˜¸

I also followup with internet culture and love curating creative works from the corners of the internet. (used to be a 4chan user untill I got friends)

If you're bored or find me cool, let's have a chat. I love to listen to people's views on life and am a sucker for good conversations (also am looking for people to start a podcast with).
