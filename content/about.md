## Hello World

This is me, Mehul, kinda like my corner of the web, I plan to make this into a rolling blog site which will be fun to maintain lol. This page is like my intro about what I do, my interests and stuff, I'll try making it fun to read I promise ðŸ¤ž

Ex Product @ *[Slick App](https://slickapp.co)* where we scaled from zero to 2 Million in 10 months (blitzscaling much?). Launched cool new features for the GenZ college audience of India and created close knit communities. 

Oh so you heard about **AI taking over jobs?** that was me, I had a team of 5 interns who I got annoyed with and automated their work over a weekend hack. Prolly says a lot about me and how I am as a person but I prefer *computers over humans* any day ðŸ¤ª. 

okay this is taking up space so imma make a special post about this [here]() ## insert post link here

I studied CS at *Manipal University Jaipur*. Where I found my love of AI and making things liked by other humans. While my time in uni, I started India's first Student Research Society called Phi Phenomenon which started a culture of research in our college which never existed before. 

I like doing that, **creating things at places which lack them.** 

I started a few startup projects of mine during the time which didnt see the light of day mostly due lack of investor interest hence, lack of funding (apparently the college name isnt trustworthy enough, they'd be drooling if it was an IIT)

Anyways, enough background, time for tech:

## Tech

Currently: MacOS with Yabai and Skhd

![Rice](/rice.png)

Love learning and building things. Converted Arch Linux user of 5 years.
JavaScript hate, GoLang and Python love

My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/notmehul/) would be a more accurate representation of this section ig

## âœ¨ Personality âœ¨

Apart from work, you can find me either reading Philosophy(currently MachiavelliðŸš©) or watching cool Art stuf (prolly Basquiat) with music in the background (most definitely Radiohead)

I listen to mostly everything non mainstream, the range goes from Shoegaze to Folk acoustic. I have quite a god complex about my music taste which led me to making this playlist, feel free to use it ðŸ˜¸

I also followup with internet culture and love curating creative works from the corners of the internet. (used to be a 4chan user untill I got friends)

If you're bored or find me cool, let's have a chat. I love to listen to people's views on life and am a sucker for good conversations (also am looking for people to start a podcast with).
