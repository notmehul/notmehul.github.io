This page is like my intro about what I do, my interests and stuff, I\u0026rsquo;ll try making it fun to read I promise 🤞\nEx Product @ Slick App where we scaled from zero to 2 Million in 10 months (blitzscaling much?). Launched cool new features for the GenZ college audience of India and created close knit communities.\nOh so you heard about AI taking over jobs? that was me, I had a team of 5 interns who I got annoyed with and automated their work over a weekend hack. Prolly says a lot about me and how I am as a person but I prefer computers over humans any day 🤪.\nokay this is taking up space so imma make a special post about this here ## insert post link here\nI studied CS at Manipal University Jaipur. Where I found my love of AI and making things liked by other humans. While my time in uni, I started India\u0026rsquo;s first Student Research Society called Phi Phenomenon which started a culture of research in our college which never existed before.\nI like doing that, creating things at places which lack them.\nI started a few startup projects of mine during the time which didnt see the light of day mostly due lack of investor interest hence, lack of funding (apparently the college name isnt trustworthy enough, they\u0026rsquo;d be drooling if it was an IIT)\nAnyways, enough background, time for tech:\nTech #Currently: MacOS with Yabai and Skhd\nLove learning and building things. Converted Arch Linux user of 5 years. JavaScript hate, GoLang and Python love\nMy GitHub profile would be a more accurate representation of this section ig\n✨ Personality ✨ #Apart from work, you can find me either reading Philosophy(currently Machiavelli🚩) or watching cool Art stuf (prolly Basquiat) with music in the background (most definitely Radiohead)\nI listen to mostly everything non mainstream, the range goes from Shoegaze to Folk acoustic. I have quite a god complex about my music taste which led me to making this playlist, feel free to use it 😸\nI also followup with internet culture and love curating creative works from the corners of the internet. (used to be a 4chan user untill I got friends)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re bored or find me cool, let\u0026rsquo;s have a chat.

Hobbies no longer provide weekend escapism, and your loved ones notice peculiar behaviors. Yet, unlike a visible injury, these symptoms aren\u0026rsquo;t noticeable enough to warrant concern, and you certainly don’t want to bring others down by talking about it as talking about it makes it real.\nOccasionally, you feel elated, overjoyed with life, and almost godlike. However, this mania further alienates and confuses those willing to listen. In moments of twilight self-reflection, you see the entirety of your anguish. Your X-ray vision penetrates the impermanence of everything around you. The insistent misery of being becomes your only sense of comfort and stability. Acknowledging that there is truly nothing to be hopeful for becomes your anchor.\nDavid Foster Wallace compared the situation of those depressed to the scenario of jumping out of a burning building. He wrote:\nMake no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view. The fear of falling remains a constant; the variable here is the other terror—the fire\u0026rsquo;s flames. When the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames.\nSo, what is Depression? #Depression can be characterized in two main ways: as a state or mood versus a full-fledged disorder. The former is an expected component of human experience, while the latter is crippling and formed through genetics and environmental factors. Major depressive disorder brings symptoms such as sadness, tearfulness, hopelessness, anxiety, insomnia, thoughts of death, and a lack of interest in activities once enjoyed. Unlike sadness, depression\u0026rsquo;s symptoms are persistent for more than a few months.\nDepression is complex. Although it is often thought to be caused by chemical imbalances, scientists have found that brain structure and neurology, such as a shrinking hippocampus, also play a role. Certain genetic factors contribute as well. Studies have shown that some individuals carry genes more likely to result in longer sustained despair after trauma compared to others. On a side note, many of these genes are also linked to inflammatory properties, suggesting that depression may have evolved to keep people healthy and less prone to sickness. This explains why preventative measures for depression, exercise, sufficient sleep, and lowering blood sugar levels are also anti-inflammatory.\nDepression is a unique feeling of unfounded dread and despair. Unlike those who are sad and can locate the source of their sadness, a depressive is unable to identify why they feel depressed. They may latch onto universal issues of the human condition, such as the apparent lack of meaning in existence or the tragedy of death, or project their despair onto insurmountable conflicts such as climate change, economic crises, or crime waves. Schopenhauer writes:\nThe vanity of existence is revealed in the whole form existence assumes: in the infiniteness of time and space contrasted with the finiteness of the individual and in both; in the fleeting present as the sole form in which actuality exists; in the contingency and relativity of all things; in continual becoming without being; in continual desire without satisfaction; in the continual frustration of striving of which life consists.\nAddressing the Source #The inability to find a source for the sadness does not mean there is an absence of a personal cause. Instead, there may be an uncovered stressor in one\u0026rsquo;s life, such as a problematic relationship, an unsatisfactory job, or even repressed trauma. Therapists work with patients to confront these incredibly uncomfortable points of contention. Many times it turns out to be rooted in things so old that the person does not even have a clear memory of it but it still is imprinted in their subconsious.\nYou might be wondering, anti depressant medications exist. If depression can be treated pharmaceutically and therapeutically, what\u0026rsquo;s the point of philosophizing over it? After all, we don’t have a philosophy of Lyme disease. It should be treated rather than intellectualized. Yet, depression is different from other physical or mental ailments. At times, it merges with genius, evident in the works of figures like Ludwig Boltzmann, Einstein and basically every good musician. The laser focus provided by depression can benefit philosophical pessimism. Should we dismiss our dark discoveries about the world as soon as our serotonin levels adjust? Depressive realism shows that depressed individuals make more realistic inferences than non-depressed individuals, particularly under fMRI scans.\nExistential Realities and the Absurd #Depression often brings larger truths that add to our despair: impending death, the death of loved ones, the anxiety of absolute freedom, and the inability to truly understand one another. Existential psychotherapy seeks to alleviate concerns with these irresolvable observations. Unlike a chemical imbalance, this therapy is used when depression stems from the unbearable aspects of the human condition. It borrows from humanistic psychology, existentialism, and phenomenology to remind sufferers to live life fully in recognition of their mortality. Albert Camus would approve of this.\nThe Philosophical Perspective #David Foster Wallace uses a classic joke to highlight the obvious, most important realities that are hardest to see or talk about:\nThere are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, \u0026lsquo;Morning, boys. How\u0026rsquo;s the water?\u0026rsquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, \u0026lsquo;What the hell is water?\u0026rsquo;\nWallace is not asserting wisdom but illustrating that the depressive carries a simple and useful awareness of life\u0026rsquo;s absurdity. Albert Camus, in his philosophy of absurdism, argues that there is a fundamental disharmony between man\u0026rsquo;s search for purpose and the universe\u0026rsquo;s inability to provide it. This incongruence creates the Absurd, a core existential dilemma.\nCamus suggests that hope is the real issue. He references Pandora\u0026rsquo;s Box, where hope remains after all the evils are unleashed. Hope torments humans by making them anticipate an ultimate reward, rather than valuing life in the present. Once we recognize the Absurd, we can live a good life. Camus himself lived without hope, indulging in earthly delights, which contributed to his wife’s depression.\nHope #Despite Camus\u0026rsquo; philosophy, hope seems psychologically unavoidable. Recent suggestions allow for a \u0026ldquo;strange hope\u0026rdquo; directed towards present possibilities. French existentialist Gabriel Marcel saw humans as beings striving for significance. Marcel argues that the drive to possess and control for meaning creates a distinction between problem and mystery.\nProblems are technical and solvable; mysteries demand participation and involvement.\nMarcel\u0026rsquo;s hope is a general and absolute one. Instead of hoping for specific outcomes, this hope asserts that everything is not necessarily lost. It is an act of patience, probing and striving towards being while accepting the mysterious character of its work. This is not optimism but a profound assertion that things may not be as dire as they seem.\nEmbrace the Struggle #In moments of despair, even in the depths of hopelessness, we should betray all logic, reason and hope as they will keep you in the same mental loops you have been stuck in. David Hume, when overwhelmed by despair, would retreat to play games with friends, finding amusement that made his speculations seem cold and ridiculous.\nWe must remember to live, laugh, listen to good music, mess up, and create beautiful and ugly art.\nPhilosophy can\u0026rsquo;t solve your depression, but it can offer a perspective.\nAt the foot of the mountain, you will always find your burden again. Yet, you possess a strange hope that rejects the need for gods and instead raises rocks. The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill your heart.\nImagine Sisyphus, happy in his defiance, for he has found meaning in the struggle itself.\n","date":null,"permalink":"/notes/depression/","section":"notes","summary":"as someone who went through a lot of depression, this is a collection of things which helped me.","title":"Depression is kil"},{"content":" the base where all blogs rest ","date":null,"permalink":"/notes/","section":"notes","summary":" the base where all blogs rest ","title":"notes"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/philosophy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Philosophy"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/psychology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Psychology"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/politics/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Politics"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/sociology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sociology"},{"content":"In todays world, we are more free than humans have ever been throughout history. We can instantly order whatever food we like, travel anywhere, and pursue any career that our heart desires. Yet, depression and burnout are on their peak levels. Why is this?\nThe after effects of hustle culture led us to a society where we are always striving to do more and be more, to constantly improve ourselves. This emphasis on self-improvement, leaves us at a very weird stage, where we are constantly burntout by trying our hardest to improve but the reality of not seeing things improve at the rate we expect them to makes us feel depressed. We embrace hyperactivity, finding ourselves in a state of compulsive striving. We have little time to connect with both ourselves and the ones close to us. We are all sucked into the myth that we are mere individuals striving to attain purely personal goals. Whereas in reality, there are so many people around us that care about us and have similar goals, not conflicting, similar. The more we continue to define ourselves this way, the more estranged we become from vital aspects of who we are and what we need to be healthy.\nResearchers like Tim Kasser have found that the principles of corporate capitalism—self-interest, a desire for financial success, consumerism, and competition—consistently lead to poor mental health outcomes.\nWhy then do we continue to endorse and embrace such a culture?\nMichel Foucault wrote extensively on the disciplinary society, a form of social organization that tells people what they should do through surveillance and monitoring. In his later years, Foucault wrote about a more specific form of discipline he called the \u0026ldquo;technologies of the self.\u0026rdquo; This concept involves the voluntary actions by which individuals set themselves rules of conduct and seek to transform themselves, making their lives into works of art that meet certain aesthetic criteria. These individuals might follow strict morning routines, for example, practice cold showers, or subscribe to self-improvement podcasts, all to feel a sense of freedom.\nHowever, as Byung-Chul Han argues, a society that normalizes this productisation of the self is more effective in extracting resources from its members than the surveillance methods of disciplinary societies. Instead of a society that tells people what they should do, this new form of control tells people what they can do. This is \u0026ldquo;smart power,\u0026rdquo; which compels people to subject themselves to power relations voluntarily. Rather than inhibiting or repressing, smart power motivates us to self-optimize. We now live in an \u0026ldquo;achievement society\u0026rdquo; where we use apps, ranking systems, and health data to determine if we are optimizing ourselves enough.\nThe auto-exploiting subject carries around its own labor camp, self-illuminating and self-surveilling.\nThis works in a far more efficient way than in a society where the populace is held down by political force or societal rules, this is internal, the ones in power don\u0026rsquo;t have to move a muscle for change to occur.\nAs entrepreneurs, we engage in auto-exploitation willingly and even passionately. The self as a work of art becomes a beautiful but deceptive illusion that the regime maintains to use as a consumer of its resources.\nThis drive to improve ourselves can take over our entire lives. The pressure to achieve, to be more and do more, leads to narcissism. As Steven Ryner writes, \u0026ldquo;Narcissism and sociopathy describe corporate America.\u0026rdquo; In today\u0026rsquo;s society, narcissism and sociopathy are not illnesses but successful strategies. It is effective to be constantly focused on ourselves, monitoring our performance and self-image, never letting our guard down. This constant self-reference develops into a rat race within oneself, eventually leading to burnout or what Han describes as \u0026ldquo;I-tiredness.\u0026rdquo; The ego grows exhausted of itself and eventually wears down. Burnout is treated as an annoyance or a failure to master oneself, seen as a weakness to be immediately addressed. However, burnout and depression are symptoms of this compulsion for achievement and self-exploitation.\nAccording to Aron Berg depression began its ascent when the disciplinary model for behavior broke, and norms invited us to undertake personal initiative by enjoining us to be ourselves. The depressed individual is unable to measure up, tired of having to become himself. This voluntary self-exploitation gives rise to a fractured soul, leading to severe dislocation and a loss of connection within ourselves let alone others.\nThis is not to suggest that self-improvement or striving to be a better person is inherently a bad thing. Such a journey is healthy and often beneficial. However, we should pay close attention to when this process collapses into a hellish cycle of excessive self-reference and exhaustion. For example: caring about your skin and health is good but you have to take a step back and reflect on things if your day involves you applying 20 layers of different manufactured chemicals onto yourself just to look better than someone who probably does not even know you. Such an outcome is likely the result of self-exploitation rather than self-improvement. Alienation is inevitable when our inner sense of value is status-driven.\nErich Fromm\u0026rsquo;s cure to this as he writes in his book \u0026ldquo;Escape from Freedom\u0026rdquo; is simple: spontaneity, seen in both artists and children. Spontaneous activity does not abide by rigid self-optimization and improvement. Instead, it embraces activity for its own sake—art, play, time with friends, and a gradual slowing down.\nSpontaneous activity is the one way in which a person can overcome the terror of aloneness without sacrificing the integrity of themselves. This relies on truly giving attention to the moment through active listening and observing.\nThe gift of listening is inaccessible to the hyperactive ego, which must constantly measure and optimize itself. To listen is to open oneself up to the world.\nOur world has made us increasingly focused on ourselves as a project, making us rigid and incapable of spontaneity. It is only in moments of extreme focus, where we are doing things for their own sake, that we can escape the burnout society. Call it a flow state, spontaneity, or resonance—we find ourselves alive only when we risk destabilizing our journey towards self-perfection.\nBertrand Russell gives us the most succinct path forward in combating self-absorption: \u0026ldquo;The secret of happiness is this: let your interests be as wide as possible, and let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be friendly rather than hostile.\u0026rdquo;\n","date":null,"permalink":"/notes/freedom/","section":"notes","summary":"In todays world, we are more free than humans have ever been throughout history.","title":"The Paradox of Freedom in Modern Society"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/cognition/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cognition"},{"content":"Purple [PUR] + [PUL] #The color worn by Roman magistrates. A color most often associated with royalty and richness of life. Originally obtained from sea snail piss for use in dyeing fabrics.\nBut at its core, what is it? well, a physicist would say it\u0026rsquo;s light with a wavelength between 380 to 450 nanometers. and he would most certainly be right. But there\u0026rsquo;s a difference here.\nBear with me for a second and close your eyes, imagine you are in a room where there are bright purple lights. What\u0026rsquo;s the kind of music you hear? Personally, I hear fast-paced electronic, similar to what someone at a Berlin rave would experience. But why did that happen, why did you think of a specific type of music which does not correlate with the color purple or the physical description of it at all?\nWhat processes went on in your brain which translated 🟪 into 🎧. How did the color purple get transmitted via electrical signals in your brain and suddenly turn into music?\nLet me give you another example, imagine you\u0026rsquo;re at a store buying chocolates. You flip to the back and find the list of all the ingredients and the different elements present in it, you can read through them a million times but that would never tell you how the feeling of eating it would be. You can only find that out once you actually eat it. and what happens then? well, your taste buds catch onto the sensations and send them over to your olfactory cortex and that information somehow turns into the taste of chocolate.\nAnd this is the main rub, we don\u0026rsquo;t know yet how sugar+cocoa+milk solids turn in your brain into the taste of chocolate. this is called the hard problem of consciousness and it is the greatest mystery in history.\nQualia [kwa] + [lia] #Imagine you are shopping with your girlfriend for a purple dress, say you find a nice one and show it to her. and she goes like \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not purple enough\u0026rdquo;.\nWHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN??\nThis my friend is qualia, the purpleness of purple, the sweetness of chocolate, the disgusting smell of piss after a heavy night of drinking. It\u0026rsquo;s the experience of sensation, the feeling of feeling something.\nDefinition-wise, qualia cannot be fully conveyed verbally. It is something which is felt. If you have never been in love, no matter how many books you read about it, you will never know what it truly is like. You will never have the qualia. Descriptions and Experiences live in totally different worlds.\nIn reality, of course, there is no such thing as the purpleness of purple, the sweetness of chocolate or real love. It\u0026rsquo;s all about how your brain interprets things. Ignorance is bliss\nIf we were to experience reality objectively, all we would see are wavelengths of light and chemical formulas of food.\nThere is no purple. It\u0026rsquo;s just one of the things our brain creates to make the living experience a little better (don\u0026rsquo;t forget to give a 5⭐️ on Airbnb).\nAnd that is the wild part, okay, so physically our brain is just meat with electricity, it\u0026rsquo;s a biological computer so how the fuck is it able to create such exquisite experiences out of simple things like chocolate.\nThis is the hard problem of consciousness.\nNow there are easy problems of consciousness too. like:\nhow can our brain quickly change focus from one thing to another? how can you control some of your behaviours but not others? the difference between waking and sleeping how does memory work? these are still not figured out but they seem close, all of them seem vulnerable to explanations through computational or neural mechanisms, but with enough cocain.. coffee scientists can definitely figure it out someday.\nBut the really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience, the problem of Qualia. When we think and perceive, there is a large amount of information being processed by our brains, obviously history and biases tend to have an effect on the experiences (which kinda sounds like an ML problem to me).\nWhy are the easy problems easy, and why is the hard problem hard? Because of the hard problems, we do not have the beginning of the beginning of a plausible solution yet. You can explain all the chemical processes in the brain, what exactly which part of it does but still you would have no idea why it makes you feel like puking every time someone lets out a nasty fart right beside you. It\u0026rsquo;s.. just a smell, right?\nSo our brain is basically a computer, it processes images and audio, outputs sounds via voice, it can do math(most of us anyway) but what separates us from the silicon life form? That\u0026rsquo;s right, it\u0026rsquo;s the experience. you can show your computer hours upon hours of Pokemon furry porn but it suddenly would not start getting aroused by it by the mere-exposure effect, there is no feeling to the processing.\nThe duality of subjective and objective reality must be broken, nothing is binary, it\u0026rsquo;s all a ✨ spectrum ✨. Break the walls down.\nDo you know what I love about this consciousness stuff? It\u0026rsquo;s the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s not some random thing being solved, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect any company\u0026rsquo;s annual turnover, and it\u0026rsquo;s not going to stop any wars. ITS ME, I am the mystery, you the reader, the mystery is inside you. and since the thing is so close, it barely gets mentioned, but it begs you to think.

I am not helping with that so you’re on your own but whatever domain you pick, you should have a unique combination of some skills there.\n“Don't just be another cog in the system, be a square peg in round holes.” ~Gandhi (probably) you have to be interdisciplinary, eg. a marketing+analytics person, a developer who can also do finances, an AI researcher who can talk to women, anything.\nthis will ensure that your employer cannot fire you because of your unique skillset. with this set, you can start spreading your influence.\nnow as an anarchist, you want chaos, not order, so you do not have to care about being nice to your coworkers (doesn’t mean you gotta be rude but that part is totally up to you) and as they can\u0026rsquo;t fire you, you will not be having any major problems with the HR.\nnext up you have to eliminate all the religious people near you, they are wasteful and add complexity to your plans. be sure to be rude to them but still in a passive way so that they never talk to you but also can\u0026rsquo;t bad mouth you to anyone as technically you never did anything.\nnext up are the managers, just outsmart them, if you can\u0026rsquo;t do that, are you even good for this?\nmake sure to have some coworkers who are chill and like you. They are crucial to have by your side. Don\u0026rsquo;t become friends with them but let them believe you are friends, this will play to your advantage at later stages.\nnow that all of these factors are set in, you can start acting on your plan.\nstart suggesting meaningful changes in the main product of the company, this will show them that you are interested in what they’re building and will make them give you more importance/responsibilities\ndoing this, steadily climb up the hierarchy until one day you’re sitting with the CEO and having a sketchy discussion.\nnow here, you have two choices, let’s go through both:\nyou can fake-agree with them (cos the only thing you really believe in is the perpetration of chaos in the world). this will give you short-term gains, and if he turns out to be wrong in the future, you were supporting them at one point so they will respect the comradeship (LAME 👎)\nthe other option is to go against him and have a dick-measuring competition to see who stands higher. (FUN 🤪)\nnow you are in a position to rat them out to the board and take over. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have evidence, forge it. this should be your goal, to be in talks with the board and oust the present ruler of the empire called your workplace\nnow that you have power over the company and what it does, you have to make sure not to forget your roots.\nthis is important, many people lose the game at this point.\nnow, due to the CEO being ousted, it will cause trouble with stockholders, loyal employees, etc.\nBUT\nYOU are the CEO now, you can just fire anyone who questions you. if they threaten legal action, send a local gang to kidnap their kids/loved ones.\nmeanwhile, wire some company funds into your personal account, it\u0026rsquo;s a little illegal but not a big deal this isn\u0026rsquo;t the most illegal thing you’re gonna do\nslowly, the company will only be left with incompetent people who don\u0026rsquo;t want to do anything.
