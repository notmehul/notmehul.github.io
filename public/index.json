This page is like my intro about what I do, my interests and stuff, I\u0026rsquo;ll try making it fun to read I promise ü§û\nEx Product @ Slick App where we scaled from zero to 2 Million in 10 months (blitzscaling much?). Launched cool new features for the GenZ college audience of India and created close knit communities.\nOh so you heard about AI taking over jobs? that was me, I had a team of 5 interns who I got annoyed with and automated their work over a weekend hack. Prolly says a lot about me and how I am as a person but I prefer computers over humans any day ü§™.\nokay this is taking up space so imma make a special post about this here ## insert post link here\nI studied CS at Manipal University Jaipur. Where I found my love of AI and making things liked by other humans. While my time in uni, I started India\u0026rsquo;s first Student Research Society called Phi Phenomenon which started a culture of research in our college which never existed before.\nI like doing that, creating things at places which lack them.\nI started a few startup projects of mine during the time which didnt see the light of day mostly due lack of investor interest hence, lack of funding (apparently the college name isnt trustworthy enough, they\u0026rsquo;d be drooling if it was an IIT)\nAnyways, enough background, time for tech:\nTech #Currently: MacOS with Yabai and Skhd\nLove learning and building things. Converted Arch Linux user of 5 years. JavaScript hate, GoLang and Python love\nMy GitHub profile would be a more accurate representation of this section ig\n‚ú® Personality ‚ú® #Apart from work, you can find me either reading Philosophy(currently Machiavelliüö©) or watching cool Art stuf (prolly Basquiat) with music in the background (most definitely Radiohead)\nI listen to mostly everything non mainstream, the range goes from Shoegaze to Folk acoustic. I have quite a god complex about my music taste which led me to making this playlist, feel free to use it üò∏\nI also followup with internet culture and love curating creative works from the corners of the internet. (used to be a 4chan user untill I got friends)\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re bored or find me cool, let\u0026rsquo;s have a chat. I love to listen to people\u0026rsquo;s views on life and am a sucker for good conversations (also am looking for people to start a podcast with).\n","date":"23 June 2024","permalink":"/about/","section":"mehul.. probably","summary":"Hello World #This is me, Mehul, kinda like my corner of the web, I plan to make this into a rolling blog site which will be fun to maintain lol.","title":"About"},{"content":" fuck big tech first of all, if you‚Äôre not an anarchist, idk what to say to you, go do a BuzzFeed quiz or smth. but you‚Äôre still welcome to read and have fun :)\nnow for the anarchists, you need to figure out one essential thing. what you wanna work in. I am not helping with that so you‚Äôre on your own but whatever domain you pick, you should have a unique combination of some skills there.\n‚ÄúDon't just be another cog in the system, be a square peg in round holes.‚Äù ~Gandhi (probably) you have to be interdisciplinary, eg. a marketing+analytics person, a developer who can also do finances, an AI researcher who can talk to women, anything.\nthis will ensure that your employer cannot fire you because of your unique skillset. with this set, you can start spreading your influence.\nnow as an anarchist, you want chaos, not order, so you do not have to care about being nice to your coworkers (doesn‚Äôt mean you gotta be rude but that part is totally up to you) and as they can\u0026rsquo;t fire you, you will not be having any major problems with the HR.\nnext up you have to eliminate all the religious people near you, they are wasteful and add complexity to your plans. be sure to be rude to them but still in a passive way so that they never talk to you but also can\u0026rsquo;t bad mouth you to anyone as technically you never did anything.\nnext up are the managers, just outsmart them, if you can\u0026rsquo;t do that, are you even good for this?\nmake sure to have some coworkers who are chill and like you. They are crucial to have by your side. Don\u0026rsquo;t become friends with them but let them believe you are friends, this will play to your advantage at later stages.\nnow that all of these factors are set in, you can start acting on your plan.\nstart suggesting meaningful changes in the main product of the company, this will show them that you are interested in what they‚Äôre building and will make them give you more importance/responsibilities\ndoing this, steadily climb up the hierarchy until one day you‚Äôre sitting with the CEO and having a sketchy discussion.\nnow here, you have two choices, let‚Äôs go through both:\nyou can fake-agree with them (cos the only thing you really believe in is the perpetration of chaos in the world). this will give you short-term gains, and if he turns out to be wrong in the future, you were supporting them at one point so they will respect the comradeship (LAME üëé)\nthe other option is to go against him and have a dick-measuring competition to see who stands higher. (FUN ü§™)\nnow you are in a position to rat them out to the board and take over. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have evidence, forge it. this should be your goal, to be in talks with the board and oust the present ruler of the empire called your workplace\nnow that you have power over the company and what it does, you have to make sure not to forget your roots.\nthis is important, many people lose the game at this point.\nnow, due to the CEO being ousted, it will cause trouble with stockholders, loyal employees, etc.\nBUT\nYOU are the CEO now, you can just fire anyone who questions you. if they threaten legal action, send a local gang to kidnap their kids/loved ones.\nmeanwhile, wire some company funds into your personal account, it\u0026rsquo;s a little illegal but not a big deal this isn\u0026rsquo;t the most illegal thing you‚Äôre gonna do\nslowly, the company will only be left with incompetent people who don\u0026rsquo;t want to do anything. This is perfect.\ncall them all to work one day at an odd time like 12 in the night (for people who work in the day) and don\u0026rsquo;t tell to why, just say it\u0026rsquo;s crucial and they will be fired if they do not show up.\nnow before they show up, make sure to keep the workplace clean, with no litter, and no random pages lying around, while you‚Äôre at it, remove all the paper there is in the room, and remove everything apart from chairs, tables, and their computers.\nafter they show up, make them sit at their desks and as soon as they‚Äôre seated, leave and lock the doors from the outside. done let them leave\noptional: you can brainwash them by playing anarchist movies on a TV on a loop for the entire time\nnow let this go on for at least 3 days, and keep monitoring with the security cameras if your employees are going insane\nby this time, outside communication would have made your stock prices collapse and the shit PR you‚Äôre getting won\u0026rsquo;t let you raise any more money.\nAwesome!\nnow shut down power to the workplace for a few hours then open the gates\nthe permanently damaged, employees will now have trauma and will quit and ruin all the other companies they work at\nnow that your employees are permanently damaged. this is your time to give a speech, explain to them how society is fake, deserves to get cleansed and that pure chaos everywhere is the only solution to it. make them watch Mad Max if it helps.\nnow that they are in your cult and will listen to anything you tell them. ask them to put on a victim mask because they were victims of a very toxic culture. this will help them get hired at other firms.\nafter they get another job, explain to them how you infiltrated the old company and ask them to repeat the cycle.\nremember the money you wired into your account? buy a ranch or a penthouse and watch shit fall down (fight club end scene much?)\ncheers and goodluck :D\n","date":"10 June 2024","permalink":"/notes/anarchy-in-the-workplace/","section":"notes","summary":"fuck big tech first of all, if you‚Äôre not an anarchist, idk what to say to you, go do a BuzzFeed quiz or smth.","title":"Beginners Guide to Anarchy in the Workplace"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/political/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Political"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/workplace/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Workplace"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"}]
